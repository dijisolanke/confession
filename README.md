# High Level Overview

- I built a [Server](https://github.com/dijisolanke/server/tree/main) hosted on Blender.

- The server uses [Metered](https://www.metered.ca/tools/openrelay/) as a TURN/STUN server

- Using typescript and React I built a UI for creating a Lobby and unique private call rooms when pair's are established

- The App is currently live on vercel [Here](https://confession-lake-five.vercel.app/)
